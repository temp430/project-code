Note 5:  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  In addition to 
monitoring commercial loan concentration risk, we manage a 
consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. 
Generally, commercial loans are subject to individual risk 
assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality 
ratings. Our ratings are aligned to Pass and Criticized categories. 
The Criticized category includes Special Mention, Substandard, 
and Doubtful categories which are defined by bank regulatory 
agencies. 

Table 5.8:  Commercial Loans by Risk Category 

Table 5.8 provides a breakdown of outstanding commercial 

loans by risk category. Of the $22.3 billion in criticized 
commercial and industrial loans and $6.0 billion in criticized 
commercial real estate (CRE) loans at September 30, 2016, $3.3 
billion and $839 million, respectively, have been placed on 
nonaccrual status and written down to net realizable collateral 
value.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We have various 
classes of consumer loans that present unique risks. Loan 
delinquency, FICO credit scores and LTV for loan types are 
common credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in 
our evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit 
losses for the consumer portfolio segment. 

Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the 
allowance for credit losses rely on delinquency-based models; 
therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality 
and the establishment of our allowance for credit losses. Table 
5.10 provides the outstanding balances of our consumer portfolio 
by delinquency status.

(1) 	 Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Loans insured/guaranteed by the FHA/VA and 90+ DPD totaled 

$9.8 billion at September 30, 2016, compared with $12.4 billion at December 31, 2015. 

Of the $3.7 billion of consumer loans not government 

insured/guaranteed that are 90 days or more past due at 
September 30, 2016, $802 million was accruing, compared with 
$5.5 billion past due and $867 million accruing at December 31, 
2015. 

Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans 180 days or more 

past due totaled $1.9 billion, or 0.7% of total first mortgages 
(excluding PCI), at September 30, 2016, compared with $3.4 
billion, or 1.3%, at December 31, 2015. 

Table 5.11 provides a breakdown of our consumer portfolio 
by FICO. Most of the scored consumer portfolio has an updated 
FICO of 680 and above, reflecting a strong current borrower 
credit profile. FICO is not available for certain loan types and 
may not be obtained if we deem it unnecessary due to strong 
collateral and other borrower attributes, substantially all of which 
are security-based loans originated through retail brokerage of 
$7.6 billion at September 30, 2016, and $7.0 billion at 
December 31, 2015.

LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s unpaid principal 

balance to the property’s collateral value. CLTV refers to the 
combination of first mortgage and junior lien mortgage 
(including unused line amounts for credit line products) ratios. 
LTVs and CLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade approach 
which first uses values provided by automated valuation models 
(AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the 
value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by 
the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. 
If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. 
The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high 
value properties, generally with an original value of $1 million or 
more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these 
properties. 

Table 5.12 shows the most updated LTV and CLTV 
distribution of the real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien 
mortgage loan portfolios. We consider the trends in residential 
real estate markets as we monitor credit risk and establish our 
allowance for credit losses. In the event of a default, any loss 
should be limited to the portion of the loan amount in excess of 
the net realizable value of the underlying real estate collateral 
value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to industry 
data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other 
institutions.

NONACCRUAL LOANS  Table 5.13 provides loans on nonaccrual 
status. PCI loans are excluded from this table because they

LOANS IN PROCESS OF FORECLOSURE  Our recorded 
investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by 
residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure 
was $8.5 billion and $11.0 billion at September 30, 2016 and 
December 31, 2015, respectively, which included $5.0 billion and 
$6.2 billion, respectively, of loans that are government insured/ 
guaranteed. We commence the foreclosure process on consumer 
real estate loans when a borrower becomes 120 days delinquent 
in accordance with Consumer Finance Protection Bureau 
Guidelines. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending 
on whether the property address resides in a judicial or non-
judicial state. Judicial states require the foreclosure to be 
processed through the state’s courts while non-judicial states are 
processed without court intervention. Foreclosure timelines var
y
according to state law.

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING 
Certain loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal 
are still accruing, because they are (1) well-secured and in the 
process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
or consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being 
classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days 
past due. PCI loans of $2.2 billion at September 30, 2016, and 
$2.9 billion at December 31, 2015, are not included in these past 
due and still accruing loans even though they are 90 days or more 
contractually past due. These PCI loans are considered to be 
accruing because they continue to earn interest from accretable 
yield, independent of performance in accordance with their 
contractual terms.

IMPAIRED LOANS  Table 5.15 summarizes key information for 
impaired loans. Our impaired loans predominantly include loans 
on nonaccrual status in the commercial portfolio segment and 
loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual 
status. These impaired loans generally have estimated losses 
which are included in the allowance for credit losses. We have 
impaired loans with no allowance for credit losses when loss 
content has been previously recognized through charge-offs and 
we do not anticipate additional charge-offs or losses, or certain 

loans are currently performing in accordance with their terms 
and for which no loss has been estimated. Impaired loans exclude 
PCI loans. Table 5.15 includes trial modifications that totaled 
$348 million at September 30, 2016, and $402 million at 
December 31, 2015. 

For additional information on our impaired loans and 
allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our 2015 Form 10-K.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  When, for 
economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial 
difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant 
period of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise 
consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR, the balance of 
which totaled $21.5 billion and $22.7 billion at September 30, 
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We do not consider 
any loans modified through a loan resolution such as foreclosure 
or short sale to be a TDR. 

We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period 
of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned 
permanent modification, to determine if they can perform 
according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial 
modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While 
loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not 
considered modified and they continue to advance through 
delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original 
terms. The planned modifications for these arrangements 
primarily involve interest rate reductions; however, the exact 
concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not 
finalized and do not take effect until the loan is permanently 
modified. The trial period terms are developed in accordance 
with our proprietary programs or the U.S. Treasury’s Making 
Home Affordable programs for real estate 1-4 family first lien (i.e. 
Home Affordable Modification Program – HAMP) and junior lien 
(i.e. Second Lien Modification Program – 2MP) mortgage loans. 

96 

At September 30, 2016, the loans in trial modification period 

were $146 million under HAMP, $28 million under 2MP and 
$174 million under proprietary programs, compared with 
$130 million, $32 million and $240 million at December 31, 
2015, respectively. Trial modifications with a recorded 
investment of $125 million at September 30, 2016, and $136 
million at December 31, 2015, were accruing loans and $223 
million and $266 million, respectively, were nonaccruing loans. 
Our experience is that most of the mortgages that enter a trial 
payment period program are successful in completing the 
program requirements and are then permanently modified at the 
end of the trial period. Our allowance process considers the 
impact of those modifications that are probable to occur. 

Table 5.17 summarizes our TDR modifications for the 
periods presented by primary modification type and includes the 
financial effects of these modifications. For those loans that 
modify more than once, the table reflects each modification that 
occurred during the period. Loans that both modify and pay off 
within the period, as well as changes in recorded investment 
during the period for loans modified in prior periods, are not 
included in the table.

(1) 	 Amounts represent the recorded investment in loans after recognizing the effects of the TDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of concessions, but are presented only 

once in the first modification type based on the order presented in the table above. The reported amounts include loans remodified of $484 million and $369 million, for 
quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(2) 	 Principal modifications include principal forgiveness at the time of the modification, contingent principal forgiveness granted over the life of the loan based on borrower 

performance, and principal that has been legally separated and deferred to the end of the loan, with a zero percent contractual interest rate. 

(3) 	 Other concessions include loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or 

reduce the contractual interest rate. 

(4) 	 Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if 
the loan has been charged down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal 
modification. Modifications resulted in legally forgiving principal (actual, contingent or deferred) of $16 million and $32 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 
and 2015, and $54 million and $78 million for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(5) 	 Reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans reported as a principal primary 

modification type that also have an interest rate concession. 

(6) 	 Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through 

delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; 
however, the exact concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are 
presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the current period.

Table 5.18 summarizes permanent modification TDRs that 

have defaulted in the current period within 12 months of their 
permanent modification date. We are reporting these defaulted 
TDRs based on a payment default definition of 90 days past due 
for the commercial portfolio segment and 60 days past due for 
the consumer portfolio segment.

Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired from Wachovia 
on December 31, 2008, at which time we acquired commercial 
and consumer loans with a carrying value of $18.7 billion and 
$40.1 billion, respectively. The unpaid principal balance on 
December 31, 2008 was $98.2 billion for the total of commercial 
and consumer PCI loans. Table 5.19 presents PCI loans net of any 
remaining purchase accounting adjustments. Commercial and 
industrial PCI loans at September 30, 2016, included $290 
million from the GE Capital business acquisitions. Real estate 1-4 
family first mortgage PCI loans are predominantly Pick-a-Pay 
loans.
